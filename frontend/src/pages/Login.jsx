/*
Summary of the Login Component
Purpose:

The Login component is designed to allow patients to log into their accounts in the hospital's patient portal. It facilitates user authentication and manages the state of the userâ€™s login status.
User Interface:

The component displays a user-friendly login form that prompts users to enter their email and password. It includes a brief introduction about the patient portal, emphasizing accessibility to medical records and appointments.
State Management:

It uses React's useState hook to manage the values of the email and password inputs, as well as a confirm password field. This state management ensures that the component can dynamically reflect user inputs.
Context Usage:

The component accesses global authentication state through the Context created in the main application. This allows it to read whether the user is currently authenticated and to update this state after a successful login.
Login Process:

When the user submits the login form, an asynchronous function (handleLogin) is triggered. This function sends the user's credentials to the backend API for verification using Axios. If the credentials are valid, the user is marked as authenticated, and they are redirected to the home page.
User Feedback:

The component utilizes the react-toastify library to provide immediate feedback to the user. It shows success messages upon successful login and error messages for failed attempts, enhancing the user experience.
Redirection:

If the user is already authenticated, they are automatically redirected to the home page using the Navigate component from React Router. This prevents authenticated users from accessing the login page again.
How It Works Together
The Login component plays a crucial role in the user experience of your hospital's patient portal. By combining state management, context, user feedback, and redirection, it ensures a smooth authentication process. Users can easily log in, receive appropriate notifications about their login attempts, and navigate seamlessly to their personalized content once authenticated.
In summary, the Login component is a vital part of your application that simplifies the authentication process for patients, ensuring they can quickly and securely access their medical information and manage their healthcare needs.
